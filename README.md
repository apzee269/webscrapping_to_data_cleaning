# webscrapping_to_data_cleaning
 The process involved web scraping smartphone data from the Smartprix website, followed by data cleaning and feature engineering to prepare the data for use in a machine learning model. The data cleaning process likely involved removing or imputing missing values, handling outliers, and dealing with inconsistent data formats. Feature engineering may have included creating new features, transforming existing features, and encoding categorical variables. The resulting dataset is suitable for use in a machine learning model for predicting smartphone-related outcomes.
